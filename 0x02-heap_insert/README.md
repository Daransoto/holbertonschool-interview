# 0x02. Heap Insert

##

### Description

This project is about solving the problem to insert a node in a max binary heap. <br/>
For task 0 (Insert node in a binary tree), you can execute the file `0-node` or compile it using ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 0-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 0-node```<br/>
For task 1 (Insert node in a max binary heap), you can execute the file `1-heap_insert` or compile it using ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 1-main.c 1-heap_insert.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 1-heap_insert```

### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |

| [0-main.c](0-main.c) | Main file for testing the insert binary tree node function. |
| [0-node](0-node) | Executable of task 0 (Inserting a node in a binary tree.) |
| [1-heap_insert.c](1-heap_insert.c) | Function that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap. |
| [1-main.c](1-main.c) | Main file for testing the insert max binary heap node function. |
| [1-heap_insert](1-heap_insert) | Executable of task 1 (Inserting a node in a max binary heap.) |
| [binary_tree_print.c](binary_tree_print.c) | Function to pretty print a binary tree (taken from [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x1C.c)) |
| [binary_trees.h](binary_trees.h) | Header file with definition of structures and functions used in the project. |
